### Steps to Add to GitHub Issues

1. **Implement Data Encryption and Decryption**
   - **Task**: Develop and implement encryption (Md5, Sha256) for data at the Bronze stage and decryption for the Gold stage.
   - **User Story**: As a data engineer, I want to ensure that data is encrypted at the Bronze stage and decrypted at the Gold stage to maintain data security and integrity.

2. **Set Up Extract and Load Pipeline**
   - **Task**: Create an extract and load pipeline to move data from the source (databases and files) to the Bronze stage.
   - **User Story**: As a data engineer, I want to set up a robust extract and load pipeline to efficiently move data from the source to the Bronze stage for further processing.

3. **Develop Transformation Pipeline**
   - **Task**: Implement a transformation pipeline to process data from Bronze to Silver stage.
   - **User Story**: As a data engineer, I need to transform raw data in the Bronze stage into a more structured format in the Silver stage to facilitate better analysis.

4. **Modeling Pipeline Implementation**
   - **Task**: Create a modeling pipeline to convert data from the Silver stage to the Gold stage, including dimensions, facts, and views.
   - **User Story**: As a data engineer, I want to design a modeling pipeline to refine Silver data into the Gold stage, creating dimensions, facts, and views for comprehensive analysis.

5. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - **Task**: Establish a development environment with limited copies of data for development purposes.
   - **User Story**: As a developer, I want a dedicated development environment with limited data copies to safely develop and test data processes.

6. **Automated Testing and CI Pipeline**
   - **Task**: Implement automated testing and continuous integration (CI) pipelines triggered by code changes.
   - **User Story**: As a developer, I need automated testing and CI pipelines to ensure that code changes are thoroughly tested and integrated without manual intervention.

7. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - **Task**: Configure role-based access control for different roles (Loader, Developer, Analyst, Automation).
   - **User Story**: As a security officer, I want to establish role-based access control to ensure that users have appropriate access levels based on their roles.

### User Stories for a Student

1. **Encrypt Data at Bronze Stage**
   - **Story**: As a student, I want to implement encryption for data at the Bronze stage using Md5 and Sha256 to learn about data security practices.

2. **Set Up Extract and Load Pipeline**
   - **Story**: As a student, I want to create an extract and load pipeline to move data from the source to the Bronze stage to understand the data ingestion process.

3. **Transform Data from Bronze to Silver**
   - **Story**: As a student, I need to develop a transformation pipeline to process data from the Bronze to the Silver stage to gain experience in data transformation techniques.

4. **Model Data from Silver to Gold**
   - **Story**: As a student, I want to implement a modeling pipeline to refine data from the Silver to the Gold stage, learning how to create dimensions, facts, and views.

5. **Establish Development Environment**
   - **Story**: As a student, I want to set up a development environment with limited data copies to safely develop and test new data processes.

6. **Implement Automated Testing and CI**
   - **Story**: As a student, I need to create automated testing and CI pipelines to ensure my code changes are tested and integrated automatically.

7. **Configure RBAC for Different Roles**
   - **Story**: As a student, I want to set up role-based access control for various roles (Loader, Developer, Analyst, Automation) to learn about managing access and security in a data environment.

### Automated vs Human Status

1. **Automated Tasks**
   - **Data Encryption and Decryption**: Implement encryption/decryption algorithms.
   - **Extract and Load Pipeline**: Automate data extraction and loading processes.
   - **Transformation Pipeline**: Automate data transformation steps.
   - **Modeling Pipeline**: Automate data modeling steps.
   - **Automated Testing and CI**: Implement automated testing and CI pipelines.

2. **Human-Managed Tasks**
   - **Development Environment Setup**: Configure and maintain development environments.
   - **Role-Based Access Control**: Set up and manage RBAC settings.
   - **Analyst Activities**: Perform data analysis and visualization tasks.
   - **Monitor Automated Pipelines**: Monitor and troubleshoot automated processes as needed.

These steps and user stories should help organize and clarify the tasks necessary for the project, ensuring clear responsibilities and progress tracking.
