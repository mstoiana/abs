# Test cases you can consider for your code:

# 1. Test for Data Encryption and Decryption:
#    - Input: Data to be encrypted/decrypted
#    - Expected Output: Encrypted/Decrypted data

# 2. Test for Extract and Load Pipeline:
#    - Input: Source data (databases and files)
#    - Expected Output: Data moved to the Bronze stage

# 3. Test for Transformation Pipeline:
#    - Input: Data in the Bronze stage
#    - Expected Output: Transformed data in the Silver stage

# 4. Test for Modeling Pipeline:
#    - Input: Data in the Silver stage
#    - Expected Output: Modeled data in the Gold stage (dimensions, facts, and views)

# 5. Test for Development Environment Setup:
#    - Input: Development environment configuration
#    - Expected Output: Development environment with limited data copies

# 6. Test for Automated Testing and CI Pipeline:
#    - Input: Code changes
#    - Expected Output: Automated testing and CI pipelines triggered and code changes tested and integrated

# 7. Test for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
#    - Input: User roles and access control configuration
#    - Expected Output: Role-based access control settings applied correctly

# Notes:
# Replace encrypt_data, decrypt_data, extract_data, and load_data with your actual function names.
# The extract_data() function mentioned in the second test is assumed to be a mock or a simulated function that mimics data extraction. In real scenarios, you might need to mock external dependencies or use fixtures.
# These tests check for basic functionality. Depending on the complexity of your functions, you might need to write more detailed tests, including edge cases.
# Replace placeholder functions like get_bronze_data(), transform_to_silver(), is_silver_data_valid(), etc., with your actual function names and logic.
# The tests assume the existence of validation functions like is_silver_data_valid() and is_gold_data_valid() to check the integrity of the data after each transformation. You might need to implement these validations based on your specific requirements.
# The simulate_code_change(), trigger_ci_pipeline(), and are_tests_passed() functions are hypothetical and should be adapted to how your CI pipeline and testing framework are set up.
# The define_user_roles() and apply_access_control() functions are also placeholders. The actual implementation would depend on how your RBAC system is designed.
# This set of tests covers the scenarios described in the excerpt, ensuring that each major functionality is accompanied by a corresponding test case.
